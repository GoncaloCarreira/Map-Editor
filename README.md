A simple Java-based Map Editor with the ability to paint, delete, save, and load squares on a grid.

## Features

- Paint squares on a grid using the space key.
- Delete individual squares with the 'd' key.
- Delete all squares at once with the 'r' key.
- Save the painted squares to a text file using the 's' key.
- Load previously saved squares from a text file using the 'l' key.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- IntelliJ IDEA (recommended)

### Installation

   git clone https://github.com/GoncaloCarreira/MapEditor.git

## Usage

- Use the space key to paint squares on the grid.
